I've created a Python file with two functions for calculating the Fibonacci sequence:

1. `fibonacci(n)` - Returns the nth Fibonacci number (0-indexed)
2. `fibonacci_sequence(length)` - Returns a list of the first 'length' Fibonacci numbers

The implementation uses an iterative approach which is efficient (O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity for the single number function).

Would you like me to:
- Add more implementations (recursive, memoized, matrix-based)?
- Add type hints for better code documentation?
- Add more comprehensive tests?
- Or is there anything specific you'd like to modify about this implementation?

[SUCCESS] Process exited cleanly.
